# n-wrap

n-wrap is a simple, lightweight Bash wrapper for the network scanning tool nmap. It was created to make it easier for beginners and IT professionals to run common nmap scans without needing to remember specific flags or syntax.

This tool provides a basic interactive menu that walks the user through selecting a scan type, entering a target, and optionally saving the output to a text file.

## Features

- Ping scan (host discovery)
- Top 1000 ports scan
- Service version detection
- OS detection
- Full port range scan
- Show local IP and gateway information
- Optional output to timestamped text file

---

## Usage

Make the script executable:
chmod +x n-wrap.sh

Then run it:
./n-wrap.sh

Follow the on-screen menu to select a scan, input your target (IP or domain), and choose whether to save the results.
